This is an app that displays all professional soccer/football matches currently being played around the world.  
The first page you will see when opening the app is a list of all the games with their scores, the team logos and names, the current game time, the league, and the country of the league that the teams play in.
You are able to click on any of these matches to see the stats.  Please note that not all games will have stats associated with them.
When you click on a match, you will either see the message that there are no stats availble for the game, or you will see a list of stats and the head-to-head comparisons of these stats between the teams.

There is an architecture diagram provided as arch_diagram.png.
I have included unit tests and some UI tests.
